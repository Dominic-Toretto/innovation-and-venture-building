          unsafe healthy facility environment like unsuitable furniture, lack of ventilation, excessive noise, inappropriate light,
           poor work space all this adversely affect productivity. working for long time in such a environment can create 
           disease like stress, suffocation, heart disease, consequently rise of poor motivation and no job satisfaction.

      <h3>Social innovation Report</h3>
      <img src="beg.jpg">
    
     <p>Beggary is major social problem and gave concern in developing countries, despite indian government
       intention's to abolish it, still continues, it need serious attention. it is a non utilized human 
       resource which drag upon the existing resources of society. According to survey, india has more than 
       400,000 beggars out of which 50% are female, begging is growing phenomenon in world now. some times beggar 
       takes baby from their mother's on rent to giver their begging more creditibility, if you try to buy something 
       they took you to shop were they contribute money given by you among shopkeeper and beggar. this beggary 
       has to be penalise but to eradicate it from root we should look profoundly into it.
       <br>what can we do to remove beggary ?<br>
       1.for child beggars we can provide them a education.<br> 
       2.we can use some beggars for labour work which does not require any education.<br>
       3.we can create an app for them to stop human trafficking by taking their picture it will be in government 
       database using which police can find them.<br>
       if evryone will help one single beggar it will remove the beggary, to try not to give them money
       but give them some work.
